<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>My name is Teodora, I am a second-year university student at Politehnica University, studying Systems Engineering. While here, I learned programming and mark-up languages, such as C and C++, HTML, CSS, and a set of technical skills that I am excited to develop and strengthen in the IT industry. As a student, I developed my time management, given the tight deadlines and also the communication and collaboration skills, thanks to the multitude of projects that I participated in.</p>
<p> Currently, I am keen to incorporate the theoretical knowledge in some hands-on work. To give you an example, I am currently starting a personal project, trying to build a system that regulates the frequency and pattern of LED lights. Besides studying, I enjoy spending quality time with friends, hiking. I appreciate this activity because it helps me improve my perseverance and I love the sense of accomplishment it offers.</p>
